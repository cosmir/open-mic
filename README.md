## What is "Bedevere"?

![alt tag](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X2xlQaimsGg/maxresdefault.jpg | width=800)

Bedevere, an alternative spelling of [Sir Bedivere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedivere), is the name of the character in Monty Python's [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail#Plot), who devises a logical test to determine whether or not a woman, brought forward by an angry mob, is in fact a witch.

Of course, and to great comic effect, there are a number of egregious errors made in the course of orchestrating this experiment, thus leading to an erroneous conclusion (that, yes, she is a witch). However, the ironic lesson of the scene is that only by conducting such evaluations in the open can an outside observer identify possible ... missteps ... and assess the methods themselves.
